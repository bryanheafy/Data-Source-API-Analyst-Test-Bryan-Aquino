# Reflections

Working on this assignment gave me a great hands-on experience with APIs, especially one as widely used as GitHub’s.

At first, it seemed pretty straightforward, but once I started testing different endpoints and ran into issues like 401s and 404s, I realized how important it is to really understand how authentication, URLs, and request formatting work.

One thing that helped me a lot was Postman’s environment feature. Using variables for the base URL, token, and API version made everything much cleaner and easier to manage. I also learned to double-check both the Initial and Current Values in environment variables—because forgetting that caused one of my biggest issues.

This project also reminded me that small mistakes like a space at the end of a URL or a wrong file extension can completely break your request. Getting used to debugging those little things made me more comfortable with API testing in general.

Overall, I feel more confident working with REST APIs now, and I think I could apply this same process to almost any data source in the future.

If I had more time, I’d try automating some of the extraction and maybe even connecting it to a small data pipeline. But for this exercise, I focused on keeping things clean, organized, and working correctly.
